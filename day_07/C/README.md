## Build instructions
### Requirements
- `cmake`, version `3.16` or later, to create build files
- `make` to actually build the file
- `gcc` or any C compiler to compile the code

### Build
First, while being in this folder, create a build folder and go inside
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```
Then run the cmake configuration
```bash
cmake ..
```
After that, you have to build the executable
```
make seven
```
And finally you can execute it
```
cd ../bin && ./seven
```
